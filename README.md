### What I learned

This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge in which I use JavaScript and DOM manipulation, which was helpful for me to remember about manipulation of HTML elements and CSS styles with JavaScript. At first it was a bit hard to do the logic, however, I feel satisfied with the result of the challenge.
